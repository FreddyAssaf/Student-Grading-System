## Introduction


Welcome to the Student Grading System project, a fundamental C++ application that I developed as a significant milestone during my first semester. This project serves as an essential tool for managing student records and grades, providing a seamless way to calculate Grade Point Averages (GPAs) and generate report cards.

Starting my journey in programming, I envisioned a practical project that could simplify the process of tracking students' academic progress while honing my C++ programming skills. The Student Grading System accomplishes just that, offering a user-friendly command-line interface for both students and instructors.

This README will guide you through the project's features, how to get started, and how to make contributions. Feel free to explore and use this project as a reference for your own learning and development!
